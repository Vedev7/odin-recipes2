    <h1>Chicken Tikka Masala Recipe</h1>
    <img src="./images/chicken-tikka-masala.jpeg" width="150">
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>For the best charred results, use a well seasoned cast iron skillet if you have one. You can also use a regular
        nonstick pan over high heat. Searing your chicken in batches of two or three to avoid over crowding the pan
        helps fry or char (not burn) your chicken pieces instead of simmering in juices.</p>
    <p>You want golden chicken pieces. The chicken will not be cooked through at this point because you are going to
        finish them in the sauce later on, absorbing ALL of the flavours of the sauce right into the meat for maximum
        flavour.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>28 oz (800g) boneless and skinless chicken thighs cut into bite-sized pieces
        <li>1 cup plain yogurt</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tablespoons minced garlic</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon ginger</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons garam masala</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon turmeric</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Kashmiri chili (or 1/2 teaspoon ground red chili powder)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a bowl, combine chicken with all of the ingredients for the chicken marinade; let marinate for 10 minutes to
        an hour (or overnight if time allows).</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a large skillet or pot over medium-high heat. When sizzling, add chicken pieces in batches of two or
        three, making sure not to crowd the pan. Fry until browned for only 3 minutes on each side. Set aside and keep
        warm. (You will finish cooking the chicken in the sauce.)</li>
        <li>Melt the butter in the same pan. Fry the onions until soft (about 3 minutes) while scraping up any browned bits
        stuck on the bottom of the pan.</li>
       <li> Add garlic and ginger and saut√© for 1 minute until fragrant, then add garam masala, cumin, turmeric and
        coriander. Fry for about 20 seconds until fragrant, while stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>Pour in the tomato puree, chili powders and salt. Let simmer for about 10-15 minutes, stirring occasionally
        until sauce thickens and becomes a deep brown red colour.</li>
        <li>Stir the cream and sugar through the sauce. Add the chicken and its juices back into the pan and cook for an
        additional 8-10 minutes until chicken is cooked through and the sauce is thick and bubbling. Pour in the water
        to thin out the sauce, if needed.</li>
        <li>Garnish with cilantro (coriander) and serve with hot garlic butter rice and fresh homemade Naan bread!</li>
